### What I learned

Loading fonts is an interesting concept, as I have always been a fan of having everything locally served. However, fonts have become much more intensive having variable fonts where there is a seperate file for each font weight and a seperate file to accomodate each browser. Using the tool [google-webfonts-helper](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts) helps with this however it is easier just adding the `link` tag.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
